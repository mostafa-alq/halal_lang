# THE OFFICIAL Halal Language

While using my halal IDE, did you ever think to yourself "Hmm, maybe python isn't all that halal since they are predators? Wouldn't it be amazing if I could write in a language that is truly halal as well....".

# LOOK NO FURTHER ! ! !

With this new language and built in interpreter, you are able to utilise a halal stack-based language to execute code. Here is a list of the syntax:

PUSH - push a number into the stack

POP - Tkae out a number from the stack and return it

ADD - Pops 2 numbers from the stack and pushes the sum

SUB - Pops 2 numbers from the stack and subtracts the first from the second

SUBO - Pops 2 numbers from the stack and subtracts the second from the first (this is here because i can)

PRINT - Prints out a string literal to the terminal

READ - Get a number as an input/output and pushes it into the stack

JUMP.E0 - Jump to label if the top of the stack is 0

JUMP.G0 - Jump to label if the top of the stack is greater than 0

JUMP.GE0 - Jump to label if the top of the stack is greater or equal to 0

JUMP.L0 - Jump to label if the top of the stack is less than 0

JUMP.LE0 - Jump to label if the top of the stack is less or equal to 0

HALT - just stop lol

TOP - Return the value at the top of the stack
